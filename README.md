# Data Structures final coding projects, New Jersey City University, Fall 2010


# What is this repo?
This repository contains completed Java assignments for my Data Structures class in Fall of 2010. 

- WeatherMapApp.java pulls in temperature info from the [National Weather Service website](http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/nj/hourly.html) and does some parsing using a hashmap

- SearchNodeq.java and SearchNode.java incorporate a text file (random_net.txt) and basically perform network searches (randomly choosing the initial node and goal node). The former uses a priority queue data structure while the latter uses a stack

		final_path.add(current_node.address);
		neighborhood.clear();
		Iterator eachArray = network.keySet().iterator();
		while(eachArray.hasNext()) {
			String[] get_array = (String[])eachArray.next();
			if (get_array[0].equals(current_node.address))
				neighborhood.put(get_array[1],network.get(get_array));
			else 
				continue;	
		}
		//System.out.println(neighborhood);
		for (String s : neighborhood.keySet()) {
			if (done_list.contains(s)) {
				continue;
			}
			else {
				add_val = neighborhood.get(s).intValue();
				cum_val = current_node.cum_cost + add_val;
				SearchNodeq new_node = new SearchNodeq(current_node,s,cum_val);
				working_pq.offer(new_node);
			}	
		}
		done_list.add(current_node.address);
		current_node = working_pq.poll();
	}
